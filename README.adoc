Hydrogen - very composable c interfaces
=======================================

Hydrogen is highly inspired by http://libdill.org/[libdill] where I first saw
this technique (in fakt it is mostly extracted from there). However it serves a
different purpose as its intended use is a general pupose c library for
creating c interfaces and has no connection to concorrency or networking.

Installation
------------
This is a very smal library. Just put `hydrogen.h` in your inclusion path. Than
add `hydrogen.c` to the compiled files.

Usage
-----
Of course you'll have to include the header at the beginnig of your code.

[source, c]
................................................................................
include "hydrogen.h"
................................................................................

The name
--------
Hydrogen is a very simple element with only one electron. It's very light and
easly composable with other elements to form molecules. It's possible to get
very much energy out of it (think of the sun, fuel cells or H-bombs) but use it
with care ...
